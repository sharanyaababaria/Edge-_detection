# Edge-_detection
### This project focusses on implementing edge detection techniques, which are essential for identifying boundaries and significant structures in images. The motive is to compare the effectiveness of different edge detection methods, including Canny, Sobel, and Prewitt.
## Libraries Used:
### OpenCV: Used for its wide range of image processing functions, including efficient implementations of edge detection algorithms.
### NumPy: Essential for array manipulations and handling the pixel data of images, which is critical for edge detection operations.
### Matplotlib: Allows for easy visualization of original and processed images, aiding in the comparison and analysis of results.
## Conclusion
### For applications that require high accuracy, Canny is typically more preferable due to its  precision in complex environments. However, if speed and simplicity are priorities,Sobel or Prewitt can be considered efficient, though less detailed, edge detection.
